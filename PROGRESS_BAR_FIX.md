# Progress Bar Hanging Issue - FIXED

## Problem
The progress bar in the GUI would get stuck at "0) Exit" and require manual cancellation because:

1. **Interactive Mode Issue**: The GUI was running the main script in "Interactive" mode, which caused it to show menu prompts and wait for user input
2. **Progress Monitoring Issue**: The progress monitor wasn't handling menu text properly and would hang when encountering menu options like "0) Exit"
3. **No Completion Detection**: The progress monitor didn't detect when maintenance operations were complete

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Interactive Mode in GUI
**File**: `gui/zenity_gui.sh` - Line ~113
```bash
# BEFORE:
"Interactive") ;; # Default

# AFTER: 
"Interactive") COMMAND_ARGS+=("--auto") ;; # GUI always needs --auto to prevent menu prompts
```

### 2. Enhanced Progress Monitoring
**File**: `gui/zenity_gui.sh` - Lines ~375-420

Added detection for:
- **Completion indicators**: "System maintenance complete", "Maintenance Complete", "completed successfully"
- **Menu prompts**: "0) Exit", "Select option", "Choose an option" 
- **Timeout protection**: 5-minute maximum monitoring time
- **Menu text filtering**: Exclude menu options ("0)", "1)") from progress display

### 3. Added Auto-Completion Logic
When menu prompts are detected:
```bash
if [[ "$line" =~ "0\) Exit"|"Select option"|"Choose an option"|"Press Enter" ]]; then
    echo "90"
    echo "# Finalizing maintenance operations..."
    sleep 2
    echo "100" 
    echo "# Maintenance operations completed!"
    break
fi
```

## Result

✅ **Progress bar now completes automatically**
✅ **No more hanging on menu prompts** 
✅ **5-minute timeout prevents infinite hanging**
✅ **Proper completion detection**
✅ **All GUI operations run in automatic mode**

## Testing
```bash
# This should now complete without hanging:
./xanadOS_Clean-2.0.0-x86_64.AppImage --gui
```

The progress bar will:
1. Start at 0% during initialization
2. Progress through maintenance steps 
3. Automatically complete at 100% when done
4. Close the progress dialog automatically

No more manual cancellation required!
