## ðŸ§ª Script Linting

- **`shellcheck`**  
  A static analysis tool for shell scripts. It identifies syntax errors,
  stylistic issues, and unsafe practices in POSIX/Bash scripts.
  *Used to ensure the long-term maintainability and security of the
  maintenance scripts.*

### Usage

To manually check your script:

```bash
shellcheck archlinux_clean.sh
shellcheck bazzite_clean.sh
```

---

## GitHub Actions

This repository uses a single workflow (`lint.yml`) that runs ShellCheck,
markdownlint, proselint, and yamllint in parallel using a job matrix.
