### 3. Enhanced User Guidance

## Implementation Details

### Functions Enhanced
1. `enhanced_final_summary()` in `lib/extensions.sh`

- Desktop notification support
- System sound notifications
- Reboot requirement detection
- Interactive completion pause
- Performance metrics integration

### Visual Elements
- Unicode borders and separators
- Emoji status indicators
- Color-coded information sections
- Hierarchical information display

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Clear completion confirmation** - no uncertainty about script completion
- **Actionable information** - knows exactly what was done and what to do next
- **Professional appearance** - polished, modern terminal output
- **Helpful guidance** - next steps and maintenance recommendations

### For Administrators
- **Better feedback** for automated systems
- **Comprehensive logging** information provided
- **System status awareness** including reboot requirements
- **Performance insights** when monitoring is enabled

## Testing
A test script `test_completion_message.sh` has been provided to demonstrate both completion styles without running full maintenance.

## Backward Compatibility
All improvements are backward compatible. The script will gracefully fall back to basic completion messages if enhanced features are not available.
